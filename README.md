- 👋 Hi, I’m @DylanKennedy and I am the student of AU
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer science, but still learning 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python, but I wanna be a full-stat developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on comp 1210 and comp 2210 in AU
- 📫 How to reach me
      email: Joongdong0525@gmail.com
   P.S: It is my first time to post my work in a github. I'm not familiar with github programs, but by uploading good work, 
        I'll help you who see this easily pass comp 1210! (I know this course is sucks and should put a lot of effort)
